DecisionHelper
==============

Man I'm bored! What could I possibly do??

I know I have so many things going on, but I can't decide which to pursue at the moment. Here comes the Decision Helper, ridding you of that nasty freedom to hesitate.

I configured a global key shortcut on my system to trigger this program, now I don't have to choose between doing pushups and studying category theory! The computer knows what's best for me and tells me!

How to use it
-------------

First, feed the program a text file containing:
- A line listing categories and their priority / weight to ponder during the high-level decision process.
- A line per task you want to be appropriately reminded to perform, along with the categories to which the task belong.

Second, reach new peaks of efficiency and performance.
